The algorithm based on the partition of the elevator for list.
Each elevator in the list get initialized their floor and times.
For each call from the calls list each elevator calculate the travel time for the current call.

At allocation of elevator, the number of the elevator change at the sixth column of the calls list,
and get update at the output calls.
